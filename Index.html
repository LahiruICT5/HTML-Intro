  <h1 id="Intro">Introduction to Web Programming</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Web programming is the process of writing code to build and maintain websites and web applications that run on the
    internet or an intranet. It involves using various programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with
    server-side languages such as Python or PHP, to create the functional, dynamic, and user-friendly digital
    experiences we interact with daily, from simple blogs to complex e-commerce platforms.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web
    browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading
    Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
    or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
    semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
  <br>
  <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
    interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
    denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
    elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as "img" and "input" directly introduce
    content into the page. Other tags such as "p and /p" surround and provide information about document text and may
    include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content
    of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
    former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
    explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio,
    primarily using the "canvas" element, together with JavaScript.</p>

  <h1 id="His">History of HTML</h1>
  <br>
  <center><img src="W3.jpg" width="30%"></center>
  <br>
  <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
    researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext
    system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee
    and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
    formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which
    hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet
    by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.
    Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by CERN SGML, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup
    Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.</p>
